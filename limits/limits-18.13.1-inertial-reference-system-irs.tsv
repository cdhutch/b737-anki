Air Data Inertial Reference Un it (ADIRU) alignment must not be attempted at latitudes greater than 78 degrees 15 minutes. All flight operations based on magnetic heading or magnetic track angle are prohibited in geographic areas where the installed IRS Magnetic Variation table errors are greater than 5 degrees. Note: No B737 flights operate in these prohibited areas.	B737 AOM Rev 9.0	Ch 18 §18.13.1 Inertial Reference System (IRS)		unverified common limits verbatim

Maximum flight operating latitude is dependent on the configuration of the Magnetic Variation tables in the ADIRU as follows, 82° North and 82° South. Exceptions. For the region between 80 degrees West and 130 degrees West longitude, the maximum flight operating la titude is 70 degrees North, and the region between 120 degrees East and 160 degrees East longitude, the maximum flight operating latitude is 60 degrees South.
