lim-18-5-2-001	18.5.2 Anti-Ice Systems ▲: Engine anti-ice must be on during all ground and flight?	Engine anti-ice must be on during all ground and flight operations when icing conditions exist or are an ticipated, except during climb and cruise when the temperature is below - 40°C SAT. Engine anti-ice must be on prior to and during descent in icing conditions, including temperatures below - 40°C SAT. Engine ignition must be on when operating in icing conditions. Warning: Do not rely on visual airframe icing cues to select engine anti-ice ON. Use temperature and visual moisture criteria specified in this section.

lim-18-5-2-002	18.5.2 Anti-Ice Systems ▲: Delaying the use of engine anti-ice until ice buildup is?	Delaying the use of engine anti-ice until ice buildup is visible from the flightdeck may allow excessive ingestion of ice and result in engine damage or failure. Caution: Do not use engine anti-ice when OAT (on the ground) or TAT (inflight) is above 10°C (50°F). Engines - Anti-Ice System.

Do not use wing anti-ice as a substitute for ground de-icing/anti-icing and inspection procedures which are necessary to comply with operating rules. Do not operate wing anti-ice on the ground when the OAT is above 10°C (50°F). Caution: Do not use wing anti-ice when OAT (on the ground) or TAT (in flight) is above 10°C (50°F).
