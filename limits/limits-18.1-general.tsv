lim-18-1-001	18.1 General: Limitations that originate from the Airplane Flight Manual ( AFM?	Limitations that originate from the Airplane Flight Manual ( AFM ) are identified by a gray triangle ▲. A ▲ in a header indicates that all limits under that header are AFM limitations. A ▲ following a single entry applies only to that specific limitation. Information is included if it is operationally significant, required by FAA Airworthiness Directive or required by another regulatory requirement. Operate aircraft in compliance with the limitations contained in this section. Flight crewmembers shall be aware of and observe all limitations. Limitations that are obvious, shown on displays or placards, or incorporated within an operating procedure may not be contained in this section. Placards or displays generally provide actual certificate limitations, not company imposed limitations. In the event of disagreement between placard or display limitations and those shown in this manual, the more restrictive limitation shall apply.
